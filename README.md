Handmade Hope
=============

This is my own implementation of Casey's Muratori [Handmade Hero](handmadehero.org "Handmade Hero").

All the code is written by me (albeit slowly).
Although I follow Casey's implementation closely, I do take decisions that deviate my code from his implemention. Most notably is that I separate the code into separate files according to ther logical structure and I do add a lot of comments to some functionalities that are rare. This is more common in platform layer, as there is a lot of inner workings that you just have to know instead of inventing it yourself, as it happens with the game logic.

I will try to document more the logic and implementation in order to explain more clear how everything is implemented.

Concerns
--------

If this code is a breach to Casey's code I might consider taking it down, but as I have written all the code myself I do not know how licensing exactly applies. But anyway, just to be clear, **this is not Casey's code at all** but my interpretation of it.

Cheers!
